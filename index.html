        <h1>Keyboard Building Service</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my website! My name is Liz, and I create mechanical keyboards.
          Building your own mechanical keyboard can be time-consuming and challenging,
          so allow me to make it easy for you!</p>

        <p>It's as simple as telling me what you want! I will then get the parts, build, and ship the keyboard to you.
          If you're a beginner, don't worry! This website has lots of information about mechanical keyboards. You can find
          informtion about everything needed to place an order.</p>

        <p>If you know exactly what you want, head over to the Order page and get started on building your keyboard.
          If you're not sure, have a look at the FAQ page. This will provide you with all the information you need.</p>

        <h2>Recent News</h2>
        <p>Keychron has recently released their new full-sized mechanical keyboard, the Keychron Q5 QMK.
          It can be brought barebones or full assembled, similar to the other keyboards in the Q line, such as the Q1 and Q2.
          I am taking orders using this case! Check the keyboard out here:

      <!-- The second div used in the three column layout. -->
      <div class="updates">
        <h2>Updates</h2>
        <p>I have recently implemented an easier way to select between Lube, Films, Lube & Films, and None, in the order form.
          This should hopefully streamline the process of ordering from me. Feel free to contact me and let me know what you think.
          Just click the mail icon at the top of the page!</p>
